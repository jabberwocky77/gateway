this is an exercise/assessment to retrieve three months of customer retail data and calculate reward points based on provided formula

there are several rest points of access to accomodate different types of requests and service level unit tests, i began some additional work on customer object, then 
abandoned it due to the need to expand a simple data set beyond the scope of this exercise, i chose not to remove it because it does flesh out the idea of a customer as 
an entity...

cheers
